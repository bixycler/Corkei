/*
⛩️ Monument to the Ancestor 🕌

In Macromedia Flash I saw,
a chain that reached, then yielded, raw.
No force was named, no sums were done,
just step by step till rest was won.

Simple strokes, yet deeply true,
the wave that flows, the world I knew.
Today I draw its motion here,
a living monument, held dear.
