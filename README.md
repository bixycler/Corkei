— Circuit of referential<sup><a title="relational">†</a></sup> knowledge &amp; effective information —

“Corkei” is pronounced /CORkay/, which rhymes with the cute “Corkie” /CORky/.

- “Referential knowledge”? Its unidirectional version means just the “know-what”, i.e. the knowledge of concrete and actual objects in the world. Here, its circular version is used, which means the knowledge of anything that can be refered to, modeled with a complex network (graph) of references with transitivity, cycles and circuits. Hence, the referential knowledge here includes both world knowledge and self-knowledge. This type of knowledge is better known as “relational knowledge”.
- “Effective information”? Actually it refers to effective communication. Unnecessary information and meaningless information are ineffective in the sense that they make the communication ineffective. Every bit of information here has its own meaning and purpose, provided by the corresponding circle of referential knowledge.
- Wordplay? Yes! Actually it's just the “Circuit/Circle of RK-EI” where “RK-EI” is the interleaving of the two pairs “Reference-Effect” and “Knowledge-Information”. 
  + “Circuit of Knowledge-Information”: In the circuit of knowledge, information flows around many cycles until it reaches equilibrium. Here, knowledge is the form and information is the content.
  + “Circle of Reference-Effect”: On every arrow of reference A→B, there is a flow of effect in the opposite direction B→A. That flow of effect is channeled by the corresponding back-reference B→A, which effectively closes their circle of reference and effect. This circle is the bulding block of the network, and is called “cirefect”. Here, reference is the form and effect is the content.
